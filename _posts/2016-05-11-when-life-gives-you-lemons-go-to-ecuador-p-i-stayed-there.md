When life gives you lemons, go to Ecuador! :P I stayed there for nine days, two days in the capital city Quito, two days in Latacunga to climb Mt. Cotopaxi, another couple of days in the adventure capital Banos, and rest of the time back in Quito. Community hostel in Quito has the best atmosphere for travelers with great food, awesome staff, and fellow wanderers who have been traveling for months. The view from the top of Mt. Cotopaxi was breathtaking. I reached there right at the time of sunrise. Banos offered biking trails with views of misty mountains, and rushing water.

Strolling in Quito! I reached here at 2 PM. It is hot out here. My definition of hot has changed a lot in last few years. To be precise, it is between 20 and 25 degrees Celcius. I took a taxi from airport to Quito. I got to witness the Mount Cotopaxi on the way. It looks huge. I wonder how is the view from its top. I am staying in Quito for two nights. People here are a bit reddish.

I checked-in the Community hostel at around 2 pm. Hannah showed me around the hostel. She is volunteering at the hostel for a month. Earlier, at Miami and Quito airport, I searched for a Spanish-English phrase book. I did not find it. I have one at home, which I forgot to pick up. Hannah tells me that I might find one around the Plaza. "Donde?", She said. It means "Where?". "It would be very useful", She continued. I set out for a walk, and to get the phrase book. The book shop is about 30 minutes from Plaza Grande. There is a tourist information center at Plaza Grande where I got a map and directions to the book store. Look for "libreria", they said.

I ended up getting a Spanish-English-Spanish dictionary. It also has a couple of pages with Spanish-English phrases. That was an hour ago. I showed the map to few shopkeepers, few passers by, and a couple of policemen. Eventually, I got to a libreria. They have two such books. I got one of them. There is a statue of Mary with wings on the top of the hill in the center. I am tempted to walk up to that. Let's do that tomorrow. Today, I am going to the Food Walking tour organized by the hostel. I'll get to taste the Ecuadorian street food. Yum! :)

We are checking out the street food in Ecuador led by Ovi, Eduardo, and Marco. Community hostel organizes a food tour once every week. We will try out 4 or 5 different kind of Ecuadorian food. It will end at La Ronda. This is the first shop in the series. The food smells really good. We have been asked to watch for cars while walking on the streets! :O

I got four of the cakes on the left with the curry poured over them. It tastes really good. I shared it with one other person. In the afternoon, I had lunch at the Mercado Central. I pointed at few things at the shop, and the lady gave me something to eat. It was a potato and chicken soup with a boiled egg and rice. I loved it.

And everyone is busy eating while we walk to the next food joint!

Moving on to the next shop. Chicken skewers. They smell good. I am gonna go for Pincho, skewers on the left side. A piece of sausage, a small potato, green peppers, and a piece of cooked banana are on the skewers.

The building on the left is a Church. Quito seems predominantly Catholic. In addition to numerous churches, there is a Cross on the top of most hills. The city is lighted up at night with the sleepless tourists. I am told to take a cab for moving around. "It is dangerous to walk alone on the streets", Hannah advised me. "What kind of dangerous? Will they take my stuff or beat me up?", I asked. I am with a large group. It doesn't matter at the moment.

The sound of a violin. Every time I hear it, I am reminded of the violin gathering dust at my home.

Marco and Ovidio introduced me to a variety of Ecuadorian food. I feel full. :P

A hot liquor made out of fruit juice, and alcohol (probably Whisky). I don't know its name. The group stopped by a restaurant at La Ronda where we tried that. I am a bit tired, and feel sleepy. Time to head back to the hostel.
