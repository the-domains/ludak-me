description: 'Strolling in Quito! I reached here at 2 PM. It is hot out here. My definition of hot has changed a lot in last few years. To be precise, it is between 20 and 25 degrees Celcius. I took a taxi from airport to Quito. I got to witness the Mount Cotopaxi on the way. It looks huge. I wonder how is the view from its top. I am staying in Quito for two nights. People here are a bit reddish.'
