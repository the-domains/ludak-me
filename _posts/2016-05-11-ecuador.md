description: 'Strolling in Quito! I reached here at 2 PM. It is hot out here. My definition of hot has changed a lot in last few years. To be precise, it is between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius. I took a taxi from airport to Quito. I got to witness the Mount Cotopaxi on the way. It looks huge. I wonder how is the view from its top. I am staying in Quito for two nights. People here are a bit reddish.'

Strolling in Quito! I reached here at 2 PM. It is hot out here. My definition of hot has changed a lot in last few years. To be precise, it is between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius. I took a taxi from airport to Quito. I got to witness the Mount Cotopaxi on the way. It looks huge. I wonder how is the view from its top. I am staying in Quito for two nights. People here are a bit reddish.

I checked-in the Community hostel at around 2 pm. Hannah showed me around the hostel. She is volunteering at the hostel for a month. Earlier, at Miami and Quito airport, I searched for a Spanish-English phrase book. I did not find it. I have one at home, which I forgot to pick up. Hannah tells me that I might find one around the Plaza. "Donde?", She said. It means "Where?". "It would be very useful", She continued. I set out for a walk, and to get the phrase book. The book shop is about 30 minutes from Plaza Grande. There is a tourist information center at Plaza Grande where I got a map and directions to the book store. Look for "libreria", they said.
